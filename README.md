# Switchy Resource Packs

A client-side add-on for [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy) that switches enabled resource packs per preset

When you switch presets, your current resource packs will be saved locally based on the preset name. When you switch back to that preset, or join a server where that preset is already loaded, your resource packs will be updated to match.

The mod can be completely disabled from its config file, for convenience in modpacks.
